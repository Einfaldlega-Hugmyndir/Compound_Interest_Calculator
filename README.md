# Compound Interest Calculator

This project provides a Compound Interest Calculator inspired by the [Networthify](https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement?income=50000&initialBalance=0&expenses=20000&annualPct=5&withdrawalRate=4) and [Money Chimp](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) calculators, designed and deployed on Github pages [here](https://afk0901.github.io/Compound_Interest_Calculator/) for users to easily calculate the future value of their investments.

It features a simple interface where users can input the initial principal amount, the annual interest rate,
select the compounding frequency, and specify the investment duration.
The calculator then computes the future value of the investment using the compound interest formula.
